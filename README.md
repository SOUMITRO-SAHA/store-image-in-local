# Storing Images Locally

To store images locally in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory in your project's root folder to store the images. You can name it "images" or any other suitable name.

2. Copy the images you want to store into the "images" directory.

3. In your code or documentation, reference the images using relative paths. For example, if you have an image named "example.jpg" in the "images" directory, you can reference it as "images/example.jpg".

By following these steps, you can easily store and reference images locally in your project.
